# BerryHunt
The game was built during academic project weeks and represents a 2D Browser Game utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game is a multidimensional scrolling platformer. The player navigates the earth creature by key input (w - jump, a - move left, d - move right).  The game objective is to find all purple berries, which makes a berry shrub appear. On collision with the berry shrub, the game is won. Collecting an orange berry decreases the player's ability to jump for a set amount of time. A few selected platforms move horizontally. If the player falls into a gorge, the game is lost. Goal of the game is to invoke a feeling of immersion in the player by the camera panning and by making them explore a majority of the canvas.
